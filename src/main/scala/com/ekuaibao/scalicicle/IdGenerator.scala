/**
  * Generates IDs using Redis that have strong guarantees of k-ordering, and include a timestamp that can be considered
  * issued by a time oracle so long as time is kept in check on the Redis instances used.
  *
  * This allows events to be generated in a distributed fashion, stored in a immutable data-store, and a fetch to
  * reconstruct time ordering at any point in the future with strong guarantees that the order is the intended one.
  *
  * We are generating an ID that will be comprised of the following:
  *

  *
  * Note this adds to 63 bit, because the MSB is reserved in some languages and we value interoperability.
